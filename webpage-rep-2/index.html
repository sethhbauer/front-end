						<a href="https://www.mikepatey.com">Mike Patey</a> was born in Gresham, Oregon, along
						with twin brother, Mark, right in the middle of 11 children. He and his wife, Chandra,
						who is a pilot as well, have 4 children. His aviation journey began in a 1971 Cessna
						172L in 2002. He subsequently earned his single/multi-engine land and sea, commercial,
						instrument, and rotorcraft ratings along with various endorsements. His natural energy
						and knack for engineering feed his love for the challenge to circumvent the norms and
						“build it better.” This drives his passion to create and build his own airplanes, which
						he uses for competitive racing, STOL, flying his family, business, and playing with his
						fellow “Flying Cowboys.” He holds several aviation records and enthusiastically shares
						his process and adventures via his
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSvdee86uThqIrloZjWwNVg">YouTube</a>

						Born in Gresham, Oregon, in 1972, Mark started life as a high-energy, curious child.
						Mark has built multiple successful companies, starting the first at the age of 15 and
						employing hundreds by the age of 21. Mark is an identical twin and lives in Spanish
						Fork, Utah, with his wife and four sons.<br /><br />Mark and his family currently own
						and operate Best Tugs employing hundreds as they manufacture the best general aviation
						tugs on the market. If you're in need of an aircraft tug, Best Tugs is the best out
						there. Past achievements have included building several other successful businesses,
						both large and small. He was the host of his own motorsports show on ESPN, and is
						consistently rated as one of the top presenters and trainers in the country.<br />Mark
						enjoys collecting, building, and flying airplanes, and donates his time and personal
						helicopter to the Utah County Search and Rescue. In 2010, the state of Utah awarded Mark
						with The Citizen Lifesaving Award. He is currently working on his latest project, a 6
						cylinder cub.

						Jason Sneed was born in Pensacola, Florida. His love of flight began early, thanks to
						both of his grandfathers. One gave him his first taste in a v-tail Bonanza at the age of
						18 months and as he grew older, he was able to work on his other grandfather's
						full-sized MD F-4J Phantom II Blue Angel replica in his garage. By age 13, Jason had
						earned enough money cleaning yards to purchase a Commodore 64, which he used to practice
						proficiency in instrument flying. In 1999, he completed training in his Cessna 140 and
						has since acquired instrument and multi-engine commercial ratings. With 2 airplane
						builds under his belt, a Rans S7S, and a Carbon Cub, he is currently working on
						“Deception”, a 330 hp Carbon Cub. He is a member of the “Flying Cowboys” and has a
						profound passion for flying, which he shares with everyone he meets as well as on his
						YouTube channel, found under “Jason Sneed.”

						Kevin Quinn is a flying freak…seriously. It's about all he thinks about, and how to do
						it SAFELY! Kevin is a former professional hockey player and played in the ECHL, WCHL,
						WHL with brief stints in the IHL and AHL. He retired in 1995 and started pursuing his
						aviation and ski life. Kevin allocates time between flying airplanes, running his
						heli-ski operation in Alaska (<a href="https://www.alaskaheliski.com"
							>Points North 24 years</a
						>), and spending as much time in the ocean at his other home in Kauai, HI. Of course
						time with his family is the most important to him. Kevin has been flying since he was a
						kid with his father and relatives growing up in Alaska. Kevin has an FAA Commercial
						Flight Instructor (CFI) certificate with an instrument rating and currently has just
						under 9000 hours of total time, most in the off-airport environment. Additionally, he's
						an EMT/ Wilderness medicine trainer, Avalanche Educator, and former President of U.S.
						Heli Ski Association (8 years) and is a Certified Heli-Ski Guide Trainer. He created the
						High Sierra Fly-in (11 years running now) and created STOL Drag, which is also the
						newest class of racing at Reno. He is a member of The Flying Cowboys and recently
						purchased a 1944 Stearman. To say he is passionate about aviation would be an
						understatement.<br /><br />Sharing his passions with others is something that he looks
						forward to daily. He will fly just about anything he can get his hands on: Airplane,
						Glider (sailplane) Paraglider, Powered Paragliger, Skydive, Speed Wing, you name it. He
						has been fortunate to fly a number of different aircraft including Helio Couriers, Super
						Cubs, Cessnas (152, 172, 170, 180, 182, 185, 206), Beaver, Maule, Highlander, Stretch
						SuperStol, and few Cirrus aircraft. His newest passion is Biplanes and the history that
						goes with them, recently being checked out in a Navy N3N biplane and then a Stearman.
						His passion really is landing bush planes above 9000' daily. He is an EAA Young Eagles
						Pilot with nearly 100 kids flown to dates, and that number changes almost weekly. Safety
						and training is his primary responsibility in life. As a father of two children (6&10)
						and married to his beautiful wife Jessica (together now over 20 years and she lets him
						fly with her full support), Kevin is set on safely accessing the backcountry and
						training others to do so as well. Making good pilots better is his mission.<br /><br />His
						Instagram is @STOLPilot and he also runs several Facebook groups including Big Tire
						Backcountry Flier Page, STOL Pilot, and Points North Heli pages.

						Steve really enjoys competing in STOL Drag and STOL events while also flying the extreme
						backcountry. Steve started flying in 2003 in his hometown of Nampa, Idaho and built his
						first Just Aircraft Highlander in 2004, becoming dealers for them in 2010. Steve is
						constantly thinking up new ways he can make these already amazing planes perform even
						better. After making a YouTube video of a dead stick take off on one of the steep hills
						in his area, flying two miles and 1500 feet down to a river bed with no engine running,
						and landing, he got a lot of folk's attention. He flew his 2014 Just Aircraft SuperSTOL
						to Valdez and finished third behind Frank Knapp and Josh Peppered. Steve also placed
						first at the STOL Competitions at Oshkosh in 2017 and 2018 and got a close second place
						at High Sierra in 2019. He won the High Sierra Fly-In STOL Drag in 2016 and had a very,
						very close second in 2017, as well as the second-best time next to DRACO in 2018.
						Needless to say, Steve is a tough competitor at STOL Drag! Steve also received the
						Charles Lindbergh Reserve Grand Champion Award at EAA AirVenture for Light Sport Plane
						in 2018 with Yee-Haw 6 and won it again in 2019 with Yee-Haw 7. Both planes have Yamaha
						engines with SkyTrax PSRU. Steve can't say enough of the Edge Performance's EPeX Yamaha
						300 HP engine in Yee-Haw 7, it's truly a beast. Steve is always open to chatting about
						Highlanders, and if you ever have questions he's happy to chat. Check out his

						Trent Palmer started his aviation career flying drones. When the FAA came out with new
						regulations in 2014, the change inspired Palmer to get his pilots license in order to
						comply with the new rules. Terrified of flying and heights, the opportunity was not
						something that excited Trent. However, by the time his training complete, he was already
						on the hunt for an airplane he could afford…and thus was born the Freedom Fox.Trent has
						enjoyed being involved in both STOL demonstrations at Oshkosh, as well as STOL Drag at
						Reno and High Sierra Fly-In, where he took 2nd place only to Draco.

						Creighton King loves flying and building airplanes. Born into an aviation lineage from
						the 1920's, Creighton soloed on his 16th birthday and has been flying ever since. He has
						a fantastic bride Tonya, 2 teenage daughters, 2 dogs, and 3 airplanes. Creighton owns a
						56 piper Tripacer he learned to fly in, a Cassutt Racer that he has improved through the
						years to gain nearly 50 mph in Reno, and an experimental Cub. His buddies lovingly
						called the cub Rusty, and it stuck. His Dad built it and Creighton helped finish it and
						that cub has continued to fly for 27 years until bending in a big cross wind crash on a
						beach. Creighton is currently rebuilding “Rusty” and making it even better. Rusty was
						flying before the other Cowboys and may have a bit of rust, but after the rebuild it
						should fly very well. Creighton is pretty good at TIG Welding as well as building light
						weight carbon parts. He likes to cover with Stits fabric and paint with a Harbor Freight
						paint gun. He is also the inventor of
						<a href="https://www.griplockties.com">www.GripLockTies.com</a>; Releasable Rubber-Lined
						Zip Ties. He spends his days working to build the company and help eliminate crappy zip
						ties from the planet.

						Hal lives in the desert of Elko, NV. In April of 2020 after working 45 years on large
						mining and construction equipment, Hal finally decided to retire and now devotes his
						time solely to aviation and his love for Rotax engines. Hal's love for aviation spans
						decades. In 1995, he and his brother-in-law built an ultralight, and was the first time
						Hal discovered experimental aircraft. In 1999, Hal bought his first Rans S-7, which he
						enjoyed tinkering with to pull more and more power out of. In 2010 he started working
						with Rotax engines, which he also modified and altered to produce even more power. With
						his latest project, Lawn Mower 3, Hal enjoys competing in STOL competitions, and having
						that extra power on such a light aircraft makes a huge difference. Flying and working on
						little airplanes is all Hal wants to do with his retirement time, and he's having a
						blast. He has over 4000 hours in Ran S-7 airplanes alone, and hopes to get many more.
